# TPS

## Introduction

Cancer of unknown primary origin(CUP), a metastatic disease with no definite primary site, accounts for nearly 3-5% of new cancer cases[1]. Lots of outstanding researchers have made a big effort in developing tools or methods to solve current limitation in cancer origin identification. Here, we represented TPS: Tumor Positioning Server, an interactive, web-based platform synthesized all published cancer origin prediction methods, to provide a convenient and comprehensive tool for CUP diagnosis community.
